#### What have you done for your project so far?

What we have done so far for our project is we built the fundamentals  of snake so far, we added movement to the snake game and added the score board to keep track of the player progress. We also created the different types of fruits that the snake can get and colored everything from the background to the snake and the fruits.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

What we have not done so far is add all the different types of fruits that we needed. The different ideas that we had was not implemented in the game yet. We are also trying to fix the collision of the snake and the fruits to make it better for the players.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

No problems so far, only thing we have problems on was doing the code correctly but we got passed most of the problems that we had.
